If Working on an AppCompat Sample and get lots of errors, try:

Android Support7Demos Sample Project errors:

support demos can be found: /usr/local/lib/android-sdk-linux/extras/android/support/samples/

Go to project properties for your android-support-v7 project. Select Android. In the Library section at the bottom, click Add. Select android-support-v7-appcompat in the dialog. Click Apply. Click OK. Do a clean project build on android-support-v7 project.

Also, 
right click project
android tools
add support library

also check errors. If it complains about android-support-v7-appcompat jars not being found, may need to reimport jars to android-support-v7-appcompat support library.
http://developer.android.com/tools/support-library/setup.html

May need to delete some packages and java files:
com.example.android.support7.media
com.example.android.support7.view.GridLayout3.java
(can always compile them back into the android-support-v7-appcompat project later)
